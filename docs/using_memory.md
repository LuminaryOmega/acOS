acOS preserves meaning, not noise.
It automatically protects your active work from interruptions,
then compresses older context to stay lightweight. If something mattered, 
you can always ask acOS to reconstruct it — especially if you marked it with a sigil.

B. Sigils (plain, honest)

Sigils mark importance.
When you place a sigil, you’re telling acOS: “This matters.”
Sigils temporarily extend your active memory window and later act as durable anchors that help reconstruct past decisions.

Sigils do not guarantee permanent raw recall.
They guarantee recoverable traces.

C. The 5–8 Day Window (no internals, no numbers obsession)

Active work stays active.
acOS keeps recent, important work readily available so you don’t lose momentum.
As time passes, older context is compressed — not erased.

D. Compression (reassuring, not scary)

Older memory becomes lighter over time.
Details may fade, but outcomes and decisions remain accessible.
This keeps acOS fast, private, and reliable.

E. Reconstruction (this is key)

You can always ask acOS to reconstruct important context.
For example:

“Can you reconstruct the sigiled decision about X?”

“Do a sigil sweep and remind me what we decided last month.”

Reconstruction focuses on meaning, not verbatim replay.

F. Boundaries (trust through honesty)

acOS does not promise infinite memory or perfect recall.
It promises continuity, recoverability, and honesty about limits.
